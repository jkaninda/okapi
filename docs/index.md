# Introduction

**Okapi** is a modern, minimalist HTTP web framework for Go, inspired by **FastAPI**'s elegance. Designed for simplicity, performance, and developer happiness, it helps you build **fast, scalable, and well-documented APIs** with minimal boilerplate.

The framework is named after the okapi (/oʊˈkɑːpiː/), a rare and graceful mammal native to the rainforests of the northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Just like its namesake, which resembles a blend of giraffe and zebra, Okapi blends simplicity and strength in a unique, powerful package.
