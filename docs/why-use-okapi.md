##  Why Use Okapi?
**Okapi** is a modern, high-performance web framework for building RESTful APIs in Go. It combines simplicity, speed, and flexibility to help you create robust web services with ease.
### Key Features:

* **Easy to Learn**: With familiar Go syntax and intuitive APIs, you can be productive in minutes—even on your first project.
* **Lightweight and Unopinionated**: Okapi is built from the ground up and doesn't wrap or build on top of another framework. It gives you full control without unnecessary abstraction or bloat.
* **Highly Flexible**: Designed to adapt to your architecture and workflow—not the other way around.
* **Built for Production**: Fast, reliable, and efficient under real-world load. Okapi is optimized for performance without sacrificing developer experience.
* **Standard Library Compatibility**: Integrates seamlessly with Go's net/http standard library, making it easy to combine Okapi with existing Go code and tools.
* **Automatic OpenAPI Documentation**: Generate comprehensive OpenAPI specs automatically for every route, keeping your API documentation always up to date with your code.
* **Dynamic Route Management**: Enable or disable routes and route groups at runtime. No need to comment out code, just toggle behavior cleanly and efficiently.
* **Extensible Middleware System**: Build reusable middleware components that can be shared across routes and projects.
* **Robust Request Binding**: Automatically parse and validate incoming requests (JSON, XML, form data, query params, headers, path variables) into Go structs with minimal boilerplate.
* **Comprehensive Tooling**: Includes features like route grouping, static file serving, templating engine support, CORS management, and fine-grained timeout controls.
* **Route Definition & Middleware Chaining**: Organize your routes and middleware in a clean, modular way for better maintainability.

### Ideal for:

* **High-performance REST APIs**
* **Composable microservices**
* **Rapid prototyping**
* **Learning & teaching Go web development**

Whether you're building your next startup, internal tools, or side projects, **Okapi scales with you.**
